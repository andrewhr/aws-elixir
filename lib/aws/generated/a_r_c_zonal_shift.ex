  Welcome to the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application
  Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC).

  You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away
  from an Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from an
  impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your
  application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web
  Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.

  You can also configure zonal autoshift for a load balancer resource. Zonal
  autoshift is a capability in Route 53 ARC where Amazon Web Services shifts away
  application resource traffic from an Availability Zone, on your behalf, to help
  reduce your time to recovery during events. Amazon Web Services shifts away
  traffic for resources that are enabled for zonal autoshift whenever Amazon Web
  Services determines that there's an issue in the Availability Zone that could
  potentially affect customers.

  To ensure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application, you must also
  configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a resource. Practice
  runs start weekly zonal shifts for a resource, to shift traffic for the resource
  out of an Availability Zone. Practice runs make sure, on a regular basis, that
  you have enough capacity in all the Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services
  Region for your application to continue to operate normally when traffic for a
  resource is shifted away from one Availability Zone.

  You must prescale resource capacity in all Availability Zones in the Region
  where your application is deployed, before you configure practice runs or enable
  zonal autoshift for a resource. You should not rely on scaling on demand when an
  autoshift or practice run starts.

  For more information about using zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the
  [Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/what-is-route53-recovery.html).
