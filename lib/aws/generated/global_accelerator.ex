  This is the *Global Accelerator API Reference*.

  This guide is for developers who need detailed information about Global
  Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about
  Global Accelerator features, see the [Global Accelerator Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html).

  Global Accelerator is a service in which you create *accelerators* to improve
  the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on
  the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits.

    * By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of
  your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard
  accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the
  Amazon Web Services global network.

    * For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing
  accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to
  directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.

  Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple
  Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to
  create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example,
  specify `--region us-west-2` on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.

  By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you
  associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the
  Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global Accelerator provides two
  static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global Accelerator provides a total of
  four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses and two static IPv6 addresses. With a
  standard accelerator for IPv4, instead of using the addresses that Global
  Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses
  from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP).

  For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across
  multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions , which
  increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard
  accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon
  EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one Amazon Web
  Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. For custom routing
  accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to
  specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC)
  subnets.

  The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it
  exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes
  traffic. However, when you *delete* an accelerator, you lose the static IP
  addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using
  them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global
  Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.
  For more information, see [Tag-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html).

  For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services
  global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on
  health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts
  instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic
  from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints.

  For more information about understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the
  [Global Accelerator Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html).

  Associate a virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet endpoint with your custom routing
  accelerator.

  The listener port range must be large enough to support the number of IP
  addresses that can be specified in your subnet. The number of ports required is:
  subnet size times the number of ports per destination EC2 instances. For
  example, a subnet defined as /24 requires a listener port range of at least 255
  ports.

  Note: You must have enough remaining listener ports available to map to the
  subnet ports, or the call will fail with a LimitExceededException.

  By default, all destinations in a subnet in a custom routing accelerator cannot
  receive traffic. To enable all destinations to receive traffic, or to specify

  Update an accelerator to make changes, such as the following:

    * Change the name of the accelerator.

    * Disable the accelerator so that it no longer accepts or routes
  traffic, or so that you can delete it.

    * Enable the accelerator, if it is disabled.

    * Change the IP address type to dual-stack if it is IPv4, or change
  the IP address type to IPv4 if it's dual-stack.

  Be aware that static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as
  long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts
  or routes traffic. However, when you delete the accelerator, you lose the static
  IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by
  using them.

  Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to
  create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example,
  specify `--region us-west-2` on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.

  Update a cross-account attachment to add or remove principals or resources.

  When you update an attachment to remove a principal (account ID or accelerator)
  or a resource, Global Accelerator revokes the permission for specific resources
  by doing the following:

    * If the principal is an account ID, Global Accelerator reviews
  every accelerator in the account and removes cross-account endpoints from all
  accelerators.

    * If the principal is an accelerator, Global Accelerator reviews
  just that accelerator and removes cross-account endpoints from it.

  If there are overlapping permissions provided by multiple cross-account
  attachments, Global Accelerator only removes endpoints if there are no current
  cross-account attachments that provide access permission. For example, if you
  delete a cross-account attachment that lists an accelerator as a principal, but
  another cross-account attachment includes the account ID that owns that
  accelerator, endpoints will not be removed from the accelerator.
