  Amazon Security Lake is in preview release.

  Your use of the Amazon Security Lake preview is subject to Section 2 of the
  [Amazon Web Services Service Terms](http://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/)("Betas
  and Previews").

  Amazon Security Lake is a fully-managed security data lake service. You can use
  Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from cloud, on-premises,
  and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in your account. Security Lake
  helps you analyze security data, so you can get a more complete understanding of
  your security posture across the entire organization and improve the protection
  of your workloads, applications, and data.

  The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets,
  and you retain ownership over your data.

  Security Lake automates the collection of security-related log and event data
  from integrated Amazon Web Services. and third-party services and manages the
  lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings. Security
  Lake also converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a standard
  open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF).

  Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can subscribe to the data
  that's stored in Security Lake for incident response and security data
  analytics.

  Adds a natively-supported Amazon Web Services service as a Security Lake source.

  Enables source types for member accounts in required Regions, based on specified

  when members is not specified, the API disables all Security Lake member
  accounts for sources. Similarly, when Regions are not specified, Security Lake
  is disabled for all the Regions where Security Lake is available as a service.
