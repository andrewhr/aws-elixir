  The Identity Store service used by IAM Identity Center provides a single place
  to retrieve all of your identities (users and groups).

  For more information, see the [IAM Identity Center User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).

  This reference guide describes the identity store operations that you can call
  programmatically and includes detailed information about data types and errors.

  IAM Identity Center uses the `sso` and `identitystore` API namespaces.
